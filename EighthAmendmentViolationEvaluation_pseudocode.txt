Algorithm: Evaluate Eighth Amendment Violation

Input: 
- facts_of_case: a set of facts related to the inmate's health or safety
- official_actions: actions taken or not taken by the prison official
- medical_records: documentation of the inmate's medical needs and treatments

Output:
- Eighth_Amendment_violation: Boolean (True if violation occurred, False otherwise)

Procedure:
1. Initialize Eighth_Amendment_violation to False
   // Assume no violation by default

2. Initialize substantial_risk_of_serious_harm to False
   // Assess the risk to the inmate's health or safety

   // Assess severity and urgency of medical condition
   If medical_records indicate a serious condition requiring immediate attention or with high risk of deterioration:
       Set substantial_risk_of_serious_harm to True

   // Evaluate potential for future harm
   If facts_of_case show high likelihood of significant harm without proper medical care:
       Set substantial_risk_of_serious_harm to True

   // Consider nature of risk
   If the risk is ongoing, frequent, or particularly severe:
       Set substantial_risk_of_serious_harm to True

3. If substantial_risk_of_serious_harm:
    // Only proceed if substantial risk is identified

    3.1. Determine if the prison official was subjectively_aware of the risk based on official_actions and facts_of_case
        // Check if the official knew about the risk

    3.2. If subjectively_aware:
        // Assess the official's response to the risk

        3.2.1. Evaluate if the official showed deliberate_indifference based on official_actions
            // Indifference is when an official knows of and disregards an excessive risk

        3.2.2. Assess causation based on the link between official's actions/inactions and harm to the inmate
            // Confirm if the official's indifference led to the harm

        3.2.3. If deliberate_indifference and causation:
            // Confirm violation if both conditions are met

            3.2.3.1. Set Eighth_Amendment_violation to True

4. Return Eighth_Amendment_violation
   // Output the final determination

End Procedure

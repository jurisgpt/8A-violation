# Eighth Amendment Violation Evaluation Algorithm  

Computational Decision Analysis of Eighth Amendment Violation 

## Introduction
This repository contains an algorithm designed to evaluate potential violations of the Eighth Amendment in the context of prison inmate care. This algorithm is particularly focused on cases of deliberate indifference, including those related to harm and serious medical needs of inmates.

## Background
The algorithm is based on key legal principles derived from several important case laws such as Farmer v. Brennan, Marsh v. Butler County, Estelle v. Gamble, and others. These are a small sample of cases that establish the criteria for what constitutes "deliberate indifference" under the Eighth Amendment, particularly regarding the treatment of prison inmates.

## Key Legal Principles
- **Deliberate Indifference**: As defined by the Supreme Court, it occurs when an official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety.
- **Substantial Risk**: The standard requires a strong likelihood, rather than a mere possibility, of harm.
- **Causation**: It's essential to establish that the deliberate indifference led to harm.
- **Objective Assessment**: The algorithm aims to provide an objective assessment based on established legal standards.

## Repository Contents
- `EighthAmendmentViolationEvaluation_pseudocode.txt`: Contains the pseudocode detailing the logic and structure of the algorithm.
- `EighthAmendmentViolationEvaluation.py`: An executable Python program implementing the algorithm.
- `README.md`: This file, explaining the project's purpose, background, and contents.
- `requirements.txt` (if applicable): Lists any dependencies required for the Python program.

## Algorithm Overview
The algorithm evaluates the presence of deliberate indifference by considering factors like the awareness of risk, the substantiality of the risk, the response to the risk, and the causation of harm. The process involves:

1. Analyzing the facts of the case and medical records.
2. Assessing whether a substantial risk of serious harm was present and known to the officials.
3. Determining if the response by the officials constituted deliberate indifference.
4. Evaluating if the indifference led to harm, thus constituting a violation of the Eighth Amendment.

## Usage
Details on how to run the Python program and the format for inputting case data are provided in the script documentation.
